web dev weekly coding challenge


Instructions
* Create a button that when clicked, adds a new div to the page
    * The div should be a black square
    * All of these divs added to the page should have a single class name
* When the square is clicked, it should change to a random color
* Each div should have an id with a numerical value equivalent to the number of squares that are in the document before being added****
* When hovering over a square element - the element's id should display centered in the square and disappear when the cursor isn't over it
* When a square is double clicked: *If the square's id is even, the square after the clicked square should be removed *If it is odd, the square before the clicked square should be removed *If there is no square before or after when you need it, display an alert saying that the element does not exist. (As squares are removed, the id displaying on hover should be updated)
